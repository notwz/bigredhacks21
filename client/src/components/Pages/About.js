      <h1>What is Daytrip?</h1>
      <p> 
      Daytrip is an immersive website experience that lets you <strong> explore </strong> different countries and their culture. 
      In a time where technology makes us more connected than ever before, we feel that there is alienation 
      between foreign countries than ever before. We believe that music is the common language that serves as the gateway for cultural exploration.
